# Parkinson's Law Vs Narayana Murthy's 70-Hour Work Week

In today's fast-paced world, we often hear about the need to be more productive, especially in our jobs. One voice that stands out is of Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, who talks about the benefits of working 70 hours a week. But let's be honest: do we really need to work that much to be successful? Or can we achieve our goals without burning ourselves out?

The answer lies in **Parkinson's Law**, which tells us that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion." Let's dive into how we can use this idea to work smarter—not harder!

## What is Parkinson's Law?

Imagine this: you have a whole day to write a report. You tell yourself there's no rush, and suddenly, you find yourself scrolling through social media or daydreaming instead of working.

That's Parkinson's Law at play! The more time you give yourself, the longer the task seems to take.

**Time Matters**: When you have a lot of time, you might waste it. But when you set a shorter deadline, you're more likely to get things done quickly and efficiently!

## Narayana Murthy's 70-Hour Work Week

Narayana Murthy emphasizes hard work, suggesting that success often requires putting in long hours. While that sounds impressive, it raises a question: do we really need to grind like this?

### Here's What We Have To Learn:

1. **Hard Work is Important**: Dedication is key to achieving big dreams.
2. **Discipline Counts**: Sticking to a routine can help you get ahead.
3. **Balance is Essential**: Working long hours can be effective, but it's crucial to avoid burnout by maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

## A Smarter Approach: Being Productive Without Burnout

So how can we enjoy the benefits of hard work without getting overwhelmed? By using Parkinson's Law!

### 1. Set Shorter Deadlines
- **Challenge yourself**: If a report usually takes a day, aim to finish it in just a couple of hours.
- **Use timers**: Try the Pomodoro Technique—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.

### 2. Focus on What Matters Most
- **Prioritize**: Ask yourself, "What task will make the biggest difference?"
- **Set clear goals**: Tools like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) can help define your goals.

### 3. Stay Flexible and Reflect
- **Review your work**: After finishing a task, reflect on what worked and what didn't.
- **Be open to change**: If something isn't working, adjust your approach.

### 4. Take Breaks and Care for Yourself
- **Short breaks are key**: Regular breaks prevent burnout and keep your mind fresh.
- **Move your body**: A 30 minute (at least) quick daily exercise can boost your energy and clear your mind.

## Conclusion: Finding the Right Balance

Combining smart strategies from Parkinson's Law can lead to great results—without needing 70-hour work weeks.

Challenge yourself to set shorter deadlines, focus on priorities, hold yourself accountable, stay flexible, and take breaks. By doing this, you can excel at work without sacrificing your health or happiness.
